1. Look up the specs for the totient nodes. Having read the Roofline paper,
   draw a roofline diagram for one totient node (assuming only the
   host cores are used, for the moment).  How do things change with
   the addition of the two Phi boards?

   I beleive that at first there would be somehow of a linear increase then it would somehow
   start to balance(as AI increases the relative GF/s increase would not be as much) 
   and just turn into a contant straight line. (y_axis: GF/s, x_axis: Arithmetic Intensity)

2. What is the difference between two cores and one core with
   hyperthreading?
   H_threading can execute multiple instructions at a time on a signle cpu; whereas
   two cores exceute 1 instruction per cycle.

3. Do a Google search to find a picture of how memories are arranged
   on the Phi architecture.  Describe the setup briefly in your own
   words.  Is the memory access uniform or non-uniform?

   http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.5842 I am not sure, but I beleive it looks Uniform

4. Consider the parallel dot product implementations suggested in the
   slides.  As a function of the number of processors, the size of the
   vectors, and typical time to send a message, can you predict the
   speedup associated with parallelizing a dot product computation?
   [Note that dot products have low arithmetic intensity -- the
    roofline model may be useful for reasoning about the peak
    performance for computing pieces of the dot product]

    Each processor can compute its own partial answer, then send it over. So as the number of
    processors increase the speedup would increase; however, as there may be bottlencks, vector size is constant,
    where it becomes so saturated that the speed will eventually stabilize.
